# Tracker

This is the Javascript backend for the ultimate tracker.

## Dependencies

You will need at least [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) 10.x.

* [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) for routering and low-level request handling
  * [Body-Parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser) to parse request bodies in `req.body` 
  * [Express-Session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) for handling sessions via `req.session` 
* [NeDB](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nedb) as an embedded document database
  * [NeDB-Session-Store](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nedb-session-store) session NeDB backend
* [Winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston) for all logging
* [BCrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) for secure password storage
* [Joi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hapi/joi) for request validation
* [UUID](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) for generating version 4 UUIDs
* [moment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment) for getting relative times
* [lodash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash) for regexp escaping

## Codestyle

* Code will be in [ECMAScript 2018](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/9.0/)
* Style rules are specfied in [ESLint](.eslintrc.yml)

## Indentifiers
Marked with `?` means it could change/be removed.

### Field types
Field type conversion happens when a step is saved. Expected inputs are all basic types JSON allows.
* `INPUT` leave as is
* `TEXT` convert to text
* `INTEGER` convert with `parseInt`
* `FLOAT` convert with `parseFloat`
* `TIME` convert to ISO-formatted string `Date.toISOString()` output

### Input types
This defines the input interface for each step entry.
* `FIELD`
* `SELECT?`

### Display types
This defines the way the field information is displayed to the user.
For example if we know a field to be currency, we could add a suffix here so that instead of just the number they see `123,00â‚¬`.
* `CURRENCY?`

### Generator types
* `STATIC` just pass through the `parameters.value` and don't even sweat
* `TIME_NOW?` this could change as well. every step has an internal createdAt timestamp anyway...
* `TIME_RELATIVE_PREVIOUS?` mostly for playing around for now

### Report
* aggregations: `COUNT|MIN|MAX|AVG|SUM`
* intervals: `YEAR|MONTH|WEEK|DAY|HOUR|MINUTE|SECOND`
